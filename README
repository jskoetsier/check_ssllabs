This is a nagios check for SSLLabs, which is still a lot of work in progress.

Requirements:

- python 3.x
- python3-requests

Todo:

- Nice up code (make things more logic)

Annoying stuff:

- The check is dependent on SSLLabs, so the check can take up to 12 minutes (timed), and Nagios doesnt like that ;-)
