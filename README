This is a nagios check for SSLLabs, which is still a lot of work in progress.

Requirements:

- python 3.x
- python3-requests

Todo:

- Nice up code (make things more logic)

Howto:

- There are 2 scripts, these need to run independently (i run it in a jenkins job) because the script timeout from nagios is a logic 60 seconds. So it needs to be ran asynchrone.

check_ssllabs_api.py: actually checks the API from Quallys, and writes it's output in /var/spool/ssllabs/<fqdn>.dat

check_ssllabs.py: checks the result from /var/spool/ssllabs/<fqdn>.dat

You could you nrpe to run this check remotely from your nagios instance.
